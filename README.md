## Hi there 👋 I am SRI HARIKA VADDINENI!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Sotware Engineer** with over **4+ years** of experience in designing, developing, and optimizing data pipelines, data architectures, and ETL processes. I love working with data, whether it's transforming raw data into meaningful insights or building scalable data solutions for business needs.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on:
* **PostgreSQL + Apache Airflow ETL Project:** Building a data pipeline with Docker and Airflow to automate ETL processes.
* **Real-Time Data Pipelines:** Exploring batch and real-time data integration using AWS and Azure tools.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
* **Advanced SQL** techniques by building projects using SQL Server Management Studio.
* **Cloud-native architectures** with **AWS**, **Azure** and **Google Cloud Platform**.
* Experimenting with **AI/ML Productionization** for scaling machine learning models.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools:

  ## Data Engineering & ETL Tools:
  * **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Orchestrating complex ETL pipelines.
  * **SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services):** Building and managing ETL workflows.
  * **Apache Airflow:** Workflow automation and scheduling for ETL processes.
  * **Informatica PowerCenter:** Data transformation, staging, and loading.
  * **Apache Spark:** Distributed data processing for big data use cases.
  * **PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server:** Database design, indexing, optimization.
  
  ## Cloud Platforms & Services:
  * **AWS:** S3, EC2, Lambda, Glue, RDS, IAM, VPC, Kinesis, cloudWtch, Athena, Redshift(Advanced Level).
  * **Microsoft Azure:** ADF, Azure SQL, Data Lake, Logic Apps, Cosmos DB.
  * **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: BigQuery, DataFlow, GCS, Pub/Sub.
  
  ## Containerization & Orchestration:
  * **Docker:** Building, testing, and deploying containerized applications.
  * **Kubernetes:** Managing containerized applications in production environments.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
* **Open-source data engineering projects** that involve modern data pipelines, ETL, and cloud-based solutions.
* **ML/AI Productionization** projects using tools like Azure, Spark, and Docker.

## 🤔 I’m looking for help with:
* **Scaling ETL processes** and optimizing them for real-time use cases.

## 💬 Ask me about:
* Building ETL pipelines with **Azure Data Factory** and **Informatica**.
* Data engineering using **Python**, **SQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Spark**.
* Cloud data engineering with **AWS**, **Azure** and **GCP**.
